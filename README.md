## Pull Request (**PR**)

#### Rules

2. Assign yourself (for anyone to quickly identify you as the owner of the PR).
3. Don't Merge without approval from your Code reviewer/s!!! (This could deal some potential damage if you do this 🥴)
4. Merge after approval. 🚢

- The **PR** title. eg. `[#675] Add prettier configuration`.
